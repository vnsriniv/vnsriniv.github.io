## About
My research is motivated by the incredible diversity of metabolisms that microorganisms possess. I believe that understanding and characterizing this diversity is the key to solving several environmental issues faced by our society.

I am currently a postdoctoral research associate at Northeastern University (Boston MA) working with [Dr. April Gu](https://sites.coecis.cornell.edu/gugroup/about-professor-gu/) and [Dr. Ameet Pinto](https://www.pintolab.com/). My current research involves characterizing the microbial ecology of phosphorus (P) cycling in both natural and engineered environments. I study the impact and ecology of microorganisms on P-removal in enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) processes in wastewater removal and recovery facilities (WRRFs), prevalence of polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) in the natural environment and their role in P-cycling. For this I use a variety of high-throughput techniques such as flourescence-assisted cell sorting (FACS), 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomics along with activity tests. More specifics about projects I am working on are provided on my [research](/research/#current-research) page.

I got my PhD from University of Massachusetts-Amherst working with [Dr. Caitlyn Butler](https://blogs.umass.edu/csbutler/) on Microbial Ecology and Competition in Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs). A major issue with MFCs is coulombic efficiency losses due to competition with microorganisms competing for electron donors and acceptors. I used both experimental and modeling approaches to characterize the competition and propose conditions under which the competition could be minimized. This could aid in scaling-up MFCs for wastewater treatment.

I got my Bachelors degree in Industrial Biotechnology from Anna University, Chennai, India where I developed an interest in using biotechnological solutions to environmental issues plaguing this world. This motivated me to get my Masters degree in Environmental Engineering from University of Massachusetts-Amherst where I performed my thesis research with Dr. David Reckhow on the fate and transport of trace organic contaminants in drinking and surface water. Here I learnt and developed analytical techniques to measure a variety of organic compounds such as disinfection by-products, endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) and pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). I also used chemometrics to study the co-occurrence patterns of various EDCs/PPCPs in the Assabet River, MA.

Details about my previous research projects are available on my [research](/research/#previous-research) page.
