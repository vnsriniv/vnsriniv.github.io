  #about: I am a postdoctoral research associate (Dept. of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Northeastern University) working on characterizing the microbial ecology of phosphorus (P) cycling in both natural and engineered environments. My research is motivated by the incredible diversity of metabolisms that microorganisms possess. I believe that understanding and characterizing this diversity is the key to solving several environmental issues faced by our society.
