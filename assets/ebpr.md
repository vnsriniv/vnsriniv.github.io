Wastewater treatment employs a complex ecosytem of bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes to treat wastewater before being discharged to surface water. Several different process types have been engineered to enable removal of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and P which can have significant impacts on receiving waters. One such process is the EBPR process which uses alternating anaerobic and aerobic conditions to remove P from the wastewater. Under anaerobic conditions, PAOs use their intracellular polymer stores of glycogen and polyphosphate to enable uptake of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) to form polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA). This results in an increase in bulk solution P. Under subsequent aerobic conditions, PAOs use their previously accumulated PHA to uptake the P in the bulk solution and store it as polyphosphate which is usually greater than the released P in the anaerobic period thus enabling net removal of P.
