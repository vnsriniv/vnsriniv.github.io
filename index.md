I am a product leader and data scientist interested in viewing the world through the lens of data. I am an engineer by education with a undergraduate degree in Industrial Biotechnology, and a doctorate in Environmental Engineering. I have performed research in water and wastewater treatment, microbial ecology and bioinformatics. I worked professionally as a consulting engineer helping design and upgrade wastewater utilies in the United States. Feel free to look around and [email](mailto:vnsriniv@gmail.com) me if you have any questions.
